3. Follow responsible disclosure practices for found vulnerabilities
4. Document and report findings appropriately

1. Use appropriate delays between requests
2. Implement connection pooling for multiple targets
3. Cache results to avoid redundant testing
4. Monitor resource usage during scans

### Security Considerations

1. Secure storage of scan results
2. Encrypted communication for sensitive data
3. Access control for vulnerability reports
4. Audit logging for compliance

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Port Already in Use**
```bash
# Kill existing processes
pkill -f node
# Or use different port
PORT=3004 node main.js
```

**Domain Restrictions**
```bash
# Add bypassDomainCheck option
{
  "target": "https://example.com",
  "options": {
    "bypassDomainCheck": true
  }
}
```

**Timeout Errors**
```bash
# Increase timeout values
{
  "options": {
    "timeout": 60000,
    "delay": 500
  }
}
```

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging:
```bash
DEBUG=security:* node main.js
```
